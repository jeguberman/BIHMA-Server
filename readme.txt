server is a minimalist low level server written in Ruby v2.4.1. It is based on this tutorial:

https://practicingruby.com/articles/implementing-an-http-file-servera

That tutorial runs out steam real fast though. I referenced this tutorial kind of often as well

I undertook this project in order to learn more about networking. The only true goal of this project is to serve a file from one computer on a local area network, to another computer on that same local area network. The picture I chose is the "speechless.png" picture because it was smallish, quickly available, and it's my favorite picture on the internet.

Behold! I have made a LAN server!
